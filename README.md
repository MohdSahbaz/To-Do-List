# To-Do List App 📝

A sleek and fully functional To-Do List app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, just the web essentials.

I created this project as a personal exercise — _“thought of building something simple using just HTML, CSS, and JS so I don’t forget the basics.”_
